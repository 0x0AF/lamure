to test direction error term

 - examine paper
 - implement on small scale in sandbox
	- for one triangle per chart, then add more triangles
	- test with case of folded over triangle

 - seems to work on small scale

	- to add to main program, calculate a direction quad at init of chart
	- then to calculate error, add quads but with area weighting - test this(need to implement element wise multiplication of SymMat?)
	- normals should be normalised!!
