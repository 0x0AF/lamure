for next week:


 - load chart file in mesh_hierarchy app - loader exists already in rectangle packing app
 - assign each triangle a chart
 - carry chart ids over into face in polyhedron
 - ...and back to trinagle_t after simplification :)

 - after simplification of each node, (or at the end when the .lod file is written) write chart id of each face into auxiliary chartlod file:
	- another list of ints, where each int is associated with a triangle in LOD file

- original OBJ texture coords need to persist through to mesh_hierarchy app, and written into LOD file


extension (next week)?

 - info about the projection of triangles on to texture needs to be stored, in order to project original uvs into new texture space
 - decide which info to write (normal, min max, 
 - implement projection and overwrite uvs
