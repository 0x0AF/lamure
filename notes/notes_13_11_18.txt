Tasks for next week


Sort and test adding stuff to vertices


Use Adrians code to see if textures are propogated through simplification process:

 - pass texture coordinates and normals and indices to polyhedron builder function
	 - can this be done with a better data struct - worth it?
 - add to polyhedron within points
 - check simplification still runs
 - manual check of post simplification mesh? 


To test, write an obj with a tex coord fields
- overwrite polyhedron writer classes to create an updated writer
 - all in /usr/include/CGAL/IO


Look into creating charts - process




Downsweep algorithm overview:

 - load i all triangles
 - make a queue of nodes with a root node

  - while queue is not empty:
  	- fetch front node
  	- sort and split along longest axis
  	- calculate bounds of children
  	- push to queue
  	- termination - min number of triangles


Node class needed with range (begin and end)
hierarchy can be stored implicitly




Upsweep:
 - simplification
 - need to consider how to treat boundaries between nodes
 -
