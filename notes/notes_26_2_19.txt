Notes from today's meeting:



steps towards solving current problems (priority order):

 - adjust background colour of texture renedered by mesh_preprocessing app to (1,0,1) to support development of dilation app

 - extend mesh_prepro to allow multiple rendering from multiple textures - consult anton about tool for this

 - adjust sizes of rectangles in rectangle packing process to ensure that each chart is transferred to the final texture at the same (or larger) size (pixels per triangle). 
	
	- use distance between vertices of triangles, compare with texture space distance between vertices
	- overall size of final output texture may need to be increased - heuristic for this?

 - Look at why holes are forming in coarser LOD hierarchy levels - is it because triangles are being thrown away? Or another reason?

 - Use an absolute clustering method to provide an initial estimate for charts - as suggested by anton (feature space of centroid and normal, for example)
