For next week:

 - Update triangle size measure - use euclidian area and convert to (float) pixel value - DONE
 - look into UV problem with zebra (normals?) - is 'solved' by scaling down zebra model. Is there a problem with the vis app and very large models? test with some others. 
	- big lion shows some similar artefacts, also causes problems with rectangle packing app.
 - update clustering method to optimise and allow parallelisation
 - add dilation to single_tex_pipeline - DONE

 - testing - try to run Nordportal through pipeline
 - finish multi-texture pipeline script


 - UPDATE CLUSTERING:

to improve speed of clustering algorithm, independent of grid clustering:

 - Use pointers to a vector of join operations to avoid copying lots of data
 - After each merge use INVERSE INDEX to identify affected join operations (pointers to JOs) and add these to a vector. Recalculation of the error for each merge could then be parallelised 
 - inverse indexing - via 2 ints for affected charts



 - UPDATE TRIANGLE MEASURE

dont use city block, use area
use average of averages rather than 90% system





//////////////////////////////////////////////////////


Changes to clustering algorithm:

 - For JOs, use a base vector of shared-ptrs to JO objects
 - multi threading - use OMP (example in opt/lamure/apps/ something called outlier)
 - in Join operations add chart ids in sorted manner (chart 1 lower than chart 2) - done

 - when executing a join, create a new chart number
	- in inverse index map, combine JOs for merged charts into a new vector, sort and call unique (need equivalence function) to remove doubles
	- how to deal with JOs in inverse index that still point to old charts?
		- when


Finish multi texture pipeline script  


times: with zebra (original size, shrunk on obj load), to 50 charts, debug flag:
./lamure_grid_face_clustering -f data/cluster_update/zebra.obj -ch 50 -debug

with join queue as pointers to vector of joins. lookup of affected joins with a pass through the join list. replacement manually to maintain sorting.
 = 1 m 32 s

join queue replaced with shared pointers:
 = 1 m 51 s
