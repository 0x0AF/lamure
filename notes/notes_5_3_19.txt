For next week:

 - Update triangle size measure - use euclidian area and convert to (float) pixel value - DONE
 - look into UV problem with zebra (normals?) - is 'solved' by scaling down zebra model. Is there a problem with the vis app and very large models? test with some others. 
	- big lion shows some similar artefacts, also causes problems with rectangle packing app.
 - update clustering method to optimise and allow parallelisation
 - add dilation to single_tex_pipeline - DONE

 - testing - try to run Nordportal through pipeline
 - finish multi-texture pipeline script


 - UPDATE CLUSTERING:

to improve speed of clustering algorithm, independent of grid clustering:

 - Use pointers to a vector of join operations to avoid copying lots of data
 - After each merge use INVERSE INDEX to identify affected join operations (pointers to JOs) and add these to a vector. Recalculation of the error for each merge could then be parallelised 
 - inverse indexing - via 2 ints for affected charts



 - UPDATE TRIANGLE MEASURE

dont use city block, use area
use average of averages rather than 90% system
