for next week:


fix simplification in mesh-hierarchy app

isolate to test operation


Edge constraints:
constrain outer borders of nodes


Charts:

cost calculation: fit average plane and then compute distance from each vertex to plane

to visualise: 

write colour as tex coords (2 element vector)

in app OBJ this will be interpreted as colour:
e.g. ./lamure_obj -f ../../data/bunny.obj



simplification works in new app (test_simplification) with old polyhedron builder
investigate what the difference is!


to create a vis file for the ./lamure_vis app:
-create file with .vis extension
-enter path to bvh file
-comments with #
-pass vis file as argument when running





to deal with triangles facing wrong way:
 - cycle through and calculate normals, discard outliers?
 - find shared halfedges, discard one of the owners (smaller)
 - test with other obj files

problem seems to come from strange edge constraint simplification:
 - creates a new triangle which doesn't follow correct mesh structure
 - this is visible between files:
	- data/nodes/simplified_node_78.obj
	- data/nodes/unsimplified_node_78.obj
