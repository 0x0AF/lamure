Next steps

- continue with quadric implementation: consult github and material from Carl

- implement system for exporting chart ids for faces, and preserving UVs in obj file

	- create simple mesh (triceratops2000) with UV coordinates
	- ensure UVs are loaded into chart app
	- output UVs correctly to OBJ file 
	- output auxiliary file with list of face IDs - implicit key, space separated
