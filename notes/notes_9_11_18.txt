TODO:

 - does CGAL polyhedron support texture/normals?
	- use function from vt_obj_renderer/Utils.h
 - create simplified mesh comparison


 - try to read mesh to write obj file in order to output it / test it

OBJ load: meshlab ~/Desktop/lamure/lamure/install/bin/data/cube.obj 



to add normals/texture coords:
 - decide which data format would be best to add them to the polyhedron, and incorporate obj loader function accordingly
 - use property maps? http://cgal-discuss.949826.n4.nabble.com/How-do-I-construct-a-WritablePropertyMap-td4662333.html
 - extend vertices? https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Polyhedron/index.html#title12

 - find out why supplied obj functions are working differently
