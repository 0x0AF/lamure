To accelerate chart creation process:

 - create initial chart estimates using coarser grid based techniques

Idea 1:
 - create regular grid within bounding box
 - assign 3d id (single number, from which grid position can be derived) to each triangle based on centroid location
 - from here, initial chart estates should be plugged into chart algorithm


Idea 2: octree
 - create sparse octree based on an error  metric within cells (e.g. normal deviation)
 - use octree cells as initial estimate for charts


Also: 
 - implement something to preserve proper UVs through chart process
 - also through simplification process! so faces should be extended really. May have to delve deeper into edge collapse implementation.
