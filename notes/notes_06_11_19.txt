for next week:

implement simplification of model with CGAL - mesh simplification app.
tutorial: https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Surface_mesh_simplification/index.html

input and output not working correctly. 

hard code model to load (off/obj)

or use tiny object loader...https://github.com/syoyo/tinyobjloader
maybe only need to incelude tiny_obj_loader.cc/.h in project



to run...make then make install, from inside lamure/lamure/build folder

to check whether obj renders correctly: meshlab

e.g: meshlab /opt/3d_models/dinosaurs/rex_skull.obj 

 - does meshlab give info about number of faces? - yes
 - does meshlab load .off s? - no, but can load them to http://masc.cs.gmu.edu/wiki/ObjViewer to see faces
 - find a simple mesh to test with: e.g. /home/hoqe4365/Desktop/off_models/benchmark/db/4/m402


 - edit tutorial code to load a simple mesh
	 - next steps...why isn't model loading working??


TODO:

 - does CGAL polyhedron support texture/normals?
	- use function from vt_obj_renderer/Utils.h
 - create simplified mesh comparison

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

To find CGAL version:

  std::cout << "My CGAL library is " <<  CGAL_VERSION_NR << " (1MMmmb1000)" << std::endl; 
  std::cout << std::endl;
  std::cout << "where MM is the major number release, mm is the minor number release, and "
<< "b is the bug fixing number release." << std::endl;

My CGAL library is 04.07.0 (MMmmb)

where MM is the major number release, mm is the minor number release, and b is the bug fixing number release.
