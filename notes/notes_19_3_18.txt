To do:


 - get a version of nordportal to run through the pipeline
	- flip combined texture? - done

 - revise chart splitting system
 - consider normalisation of error metrics

 - dilation - something from last repo could be reused?






Priorities for final 2 weeks of project:

 - Dilation (milky way)
 - Support multiple input textures (without combining to 1 large texture)
 - Support writing to multiple output textures

Further notes:

 - for the final presentation, think about which parameters should be frozen for timing meshes of different sizes
 	- could be done on machined with more cores, if heavily parallelised
	- can ssh to more powerful machines if they are not in use, but display is needed
 - test pipeline with very large models (Halberstadt/kopf/wappen)
 - Update pipelines to not copy all objs...read objs in place and create temporary foolder that is overwritten each time?


Organisational:

 - presentation 24th April
 - implementation until 1 April
 - Prepare slides before 10th April
 - practice presentation on 23rd April


////////////////////////////////////////////////

Multiple input textures

When reading first chart file, form an index of textures images, and save the index for each face.

in mesh preprocessing render function, loop for each texture:
 - load texture, bind 
 - fill vertex buffer, bind
 - render the triangles that belong to each texture id



////////////////////////////////////////////////

Multiple output textures

If output texture needs to be larger than 8k, it should be split into multiple texture images.

Rectangle packing runs as before, potentially packing across output textures. 

Each output texture is created by a viewport render. In the case of multiple input textures, 
each input texture should be rendered for each viewport.

Coordinates (new coords) of every triangle need to be shifted and scaled to reflect each output texture's position WRT the complete output texture. 



Post:
 - each image will be dilated individually
 - images will be combined as input for VT (ask Anton for support here?)
