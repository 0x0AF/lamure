For next week:

 - Finish edge constraint - review result
	- adrien will update CGAL

 - finish chart creation
	- 


Next steps for chart simplification:
 1. create charts from hi-res mesh
 2. project triangles on best plane into rectangles
 3. pack rectangles into texture space
 4. render to texture



For the intermediate presentation:

 - introduce motivation for method:
	- LOD mesh loading with coherent texturing
	- 
 - describe choice of methods - against progressive texturing - and jusitfy choice
 - describe road map for progress:
	- solving chart problems
	- solving simplification problems - over complicated border edges


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

done:

 - edge constraint impemented and working, looks good at finer detail but streaking persists at low levels (and dissappearing triangles in low detail)

 - charts fixed but:
	- improve vis capabilities - better colour differences
	- map to textures in a more sensible manner
	- why does meshlab not load them?


TO DO: 
 - develop error metric for joins
	- use lamure function for calculating normals/CGAL?
	- compare difference in normals - arccos of dot product between normals
	- accumulate error at joins

 - continue debugging obj printing
 	- problem occurs in schism function to create vertex buffer from imported obj


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

done: 

 - started adding normals into join cost calculation

 - obj output problem occurs in schism call to create vertex buffer from obj
