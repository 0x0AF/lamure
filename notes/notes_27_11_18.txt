For next week:

 - Finish edge constraint - review result
	- adrien will update CGAL

 - finish chart creation
	- 


Next steps for chart simplification:
 1. create charts from hires mesh
 2. project triangles on best plane into rectangles
 3. pack rectangles into texture space
 4. render to texture



For the intermediate presentation:

 - introduce motivation for method:
	- LOD mesh loading with coherent texturing
	- 
 - describe choice of methods - against progressive texturing - and jusitfy choice
 - describe road map for progress:
	- solving chart problems
	- solving simplification problems - over complicated border edges
