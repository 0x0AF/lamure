This repository is a fork of [LAMURE](https://github.com/vrsys/lamure) by [Virtual Reality Systems Group at the Bauhaus-UniversitÃ¤t Weimar](http://www.uni-weimar.de/medien/vr) created for the [Project Visual Provenance](https://www.uni-weimar.de/de/medien/professuren/vr/teaching/ss-2017/project-visual-provenance/).

>In the field of 3D-Digitalization, a vast number of factors influence the quality of reconstruction and visualization. Therefore, a detailed analysis over the course of data processing is essential for facilitating quality assurance and comparison not only across different sensors but also across different processing pipelines.

>Historically, the term provenance refers to the origin of an object with respect to its whole but also to its details. In this sense, we strive to identify, prioritize, record and visualize so-called provenance-data that aggregates during structure-from-motion (SfM) reconstruction as well as multi-resolution processing of very large scanned datasets. However, the fusion of comprehensive amounts of provenance-data with very large 3D-scans and its real-time access is a challenging problem.

>In this project, we will extract provenance-related meta-/para-data from a series of toolchains, including our scanned data simplification pipeline. Students will design and implement a spatial datastructure to organize and store this information efficiently and with real-time-access demands in mind. Finally, students will create exciting and novel visualizations for exploring, understanding and assessing the quality of digitized material in real-time. We will work with our existing frameworks Lamure and Avango/Guacamole.

### NVM Explorer

Functional requirements:

1. Consume SfM workspace from [NVM](http://ccwu.me/vsfm/doc.html#nvm) input file via:
```./nvm_explorer -f <input_file.nvm>```.
2. Display camera objects while rendering image textures at their respective positions/quaternions.
3. Display sparse point cloud while highlighting corresponding measurements in respective image textures during interaction.
4. Allow for intuitive navigation through the rendered scene.
